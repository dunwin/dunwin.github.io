## Excerpt

According to Colour Blind Awareness 4.5% of the population are color-blind. If your audience is mostly male this increases to 8%. Designing for color-blind people can be easily forgotten because most designers aren’t color-blind.

There are many types of color blindness but it comes down to not seeing color clearly, getting colors mixed up, or not being able to differentiate between certain colors. **These problems can also be exacerbated by the environments in which people use websites.** This could include low-quality monitors, bad lighting, screen glare, tiny mobile screens and sitting far away from a huge television screen.
Relying *solely* on color for readability and affordance makes a website difficult to use, which ultimately affects readership and sales.

### Text Readability

To ensure text is readable it should pass accessibility guidelines based on the combination of text color, background color and text size.

### Text Overlaid On Background Images

Text overlaid on imagery is tricky because some or all of the image may not have sufficient contrast in relation to the text. Reducing the background opacity increases the contrast, making the text easier to read. Alternatively, you can style the text itself to have a solid color or a drop shadow, or anything else that matches your brand guidelines.

### Color Filters, Pickers And Swatches

Without descriptive text on color swatches, it is impossible for a colorblind user to differentiate between many of the options available. Adding a text label beside each color can be a method to solve this problem. This happens to be beneficial for people with normal vision too. For example, black and navy are difficult colors to differentiate on screen. A text label takes the guesswork out of it.

### Link Recognition

Links should be easy to spot without relying on color. To find a link, users should not have to hover with their mouse waiting for the cursor to change to a pointer. On mobile, they are left to tap on text hoping it will make a page request. Links with icons are easier to see. For those without, it would be a good idea to add an underline.

### Color Combinations

In the physical world you can’t always control which colors appear next to one another: a red apple may have dropped and nestled itself into some green grass. However, we can control the colors we use to design our website. The following color combinations should be avoided where possible:

- green/red
- green/brown
- blue/purple
- green/blue
- light green/yellow
- blue/grey
- green/grey
- green/black

### Form Placeholders

Using a placeholder without a label is problematic because placeholder text usually lacks sufficient contrast. Increasing the contrast is not advisable because it will then be hard to tell the difference between placeholder text and user input. It’s better to use labels with sufficient contrast.

### Primary Buttons

Often, primary buttons use color alone to present themselves. Instead, consider using size, placement, boldness, contrast, borders, icons and anything else that will help.

### Alert Messaging

Success and error messages are often colored green and red respectively. Most color-blind people don’t suffer from achromatism, and so will naturally associate different colors with different messages. However, using prefix text such as “Success” or an icon makes it quick and easy to read.

### Required Form Fields

Denoting required fields with color is a problem because some people may not be able to see the differences. Instead, you could consider:

- Marking required fields with an asterisk.
- Marking required fields with “required.”
- Where possible, remove optional fields altogether.

### Graphs

Color is often used to signify different segments of a graph. Using patterns and placing text within each segment makes graphs easy to understand. When text doesn’t fit – as is often the case with a small pie chart segment – using a key will suffice.

### Conclusion

These tips are not exhaustive, and they are not necessarily applicable to every situation. However, they do cover the majority of problems color-blind people experience when using websites.

It’s more important to take away the principles, so that you can integrate them into your own design process. Ultimately, websites aren’t just meant to look good – they are meant to be **easy to use for everyone.**
